## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/AhORJZag/labs13-school-cloud)

[Product Canvas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Vk_nvEgRby8hfZROtnxEASSR3nSWivKVPA2nKoVDX0/edit#heading=h.vxc4myjh3d6x)


School in the Cloud is a platform that trains senior volunteers to teach students in a group or individual setting.  This helps kids in communities with high student to teacher ratios. It also provides retired volunteers a sense of purpose and meaning in their day to day life when they find themselves with more free time.  The platform also connects volunteers with the students. The aim is to help close the achievement gap by connecting students with available, qualified volunteer mentors. 


### Key Features

- Onboarding for two user types: Admin and Volunteer. Each user type will have their own view.
- ADMIN FEATURES
- Ability for an admin to create and edit a training schedule for volunteers to complete.  (See the previous labs project training bot. This project can build off training bot. It should create an online view for the volunteer to see each training module and complete it online.)
- Ability to create an account on behalf of a new volunteer, and send an email link to volunteer‚Äôs email to complete the sign up. 
- Ability to create an account on behalf of a new classroom, and send an email link to volunteer‚Äôs email to complete the sign up. 
- Admin can visit an approval Page to view volunteers training progress and approve pending volunteer accounts based on completion of training
- Volunteers can log in with a magic link to see their training lists
- Volunteer can view their training they need to complete, can mark training as complete, and completion is reported to the admin.

# APIs

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Payment API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

üö´These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products

# Licenses

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Installation Instructions

üö´explain how to install the required dependencies to get this project up and running with yarn and NPM

## Other Scripts

üö´replace these examples with your own

    * typecheck - runs the TypeScript compiler
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them

## Background

As Training Bot 2, we inherited our code base, as you do now, but found we were uncertain we could accomplish our goals with the code that we were given.  So we sacrificed some of our development time to refactor the code bases and designed it with future teams in mind (you'll have to let us know if we were successful or not)!  

While the front end refactor was never 100% completed, the heavy lifting has already been done.  With all of our features and documentation added, the React portion of the app is actually significantly lighter than when we found it.  We have created reusable components that should make expanding any features far easier and our two main components (SearchCard and NotificationsCard) are largely stripped of context and can be used again on a whim!

So now we pass the project on to you, much more robust than we found it, and we hope our efforts make your transition easier and that you're able to expand upon the ideas we started.  So in our final week, we've prepared these docs for you and added a one-click feature to get a live version of the app running ideally on day one.  We really loved working on Training Bot and hope you do too!

## Deploy

We've configured a one-click deploy to Netlify that will allow you to get the front end of the site up and running with a guided set up:

## Auth

TODO: Write Auth section

    Probably just want to write a description on how auth system works

## Store

    The actions/store setup for this application are fairly standard for react/redux applications you've likely worked with in the past. You'll notice that actions are split into separate folders based on what they're used for. All actions are being exported via index.js and can be referenced as such. Reducers are similar, in that they are being split into separate reducers dependent on usage and combined via Redux's "combineReducers". You can reference individual reducers via their specific files. The store itself lives entirely inside of index.js "rootReducer".
